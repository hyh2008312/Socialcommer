        SocialCommer is a social commerce platform that provides the tools and technology for our users to set up an
        online store and sell affiliate products on their social media and other online channels. While we believe the
        free and open exchange of ideas and products is a key tenet of commerce, there are some activities that are
        incompatible with SocialCommer’s mission to make commerce better for everyone. This Acceptable Use Policy
